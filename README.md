### What This Really Is...
A project for General Assembly's WDI course, we (The Gentlemen's Whisky & Pipe-Smoking Club) have created a SPA consisting of a brochure site and ticket-booking app for a hypothetical tech conference.

### Technologies Used:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* mLab
* JavaScript (ES6)
* jQuery
* Stripe
* SendGrid
* SASS
* webpack
* Heroku

### Issues Faced:
Our main challenge was learning several new tools in a short timeframe (but then, this was also the point of doing the project). None of us had experience with MongoDB, Stripe, or SendGrid, and only very limited experience developing Node backends or using build tools like webpack.

Working out how to fit all these parts together was frustrating but also rewarding.

### Future Features:
We would like to improve the emails sent via SendGrid by incorporating html templates, and possibly use something like node-qrcode to include a QR Code in the email that can then be scanned by staff at the event.

Possibly other stuff I can't think of right now.
